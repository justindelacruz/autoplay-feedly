# Autoplay Videos for Feedly

Adds video controls and automatically plays videos from within Feedly. 

This is particularly useful for feeds that post many embedded videos, because Feedly doesn't play or show controls for videos by default, forcing users to click through to view.

## How to use

- Install extension from Chrome Web Store (link TBD).
- Load (or restart) Feedly.
- Videos should automatically play.
