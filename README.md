# Autoplay Videos for Feedly

Chrome Extension to autoplay videos from within Feedly. Useful when you subscribe to feeds that post embedded video. 

By default, Feedly doesn't play or show controls for videos, forcing users to click through to view. This extension adds video controls and starts playing the video automatically.

## How to use

- Install extension from Chrome Web Store (link TBD).
- Load (or restart) Feedly.
- Videos should automatically play.
